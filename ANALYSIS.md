Design

My GDocs log like HTML interface that loads JSon file(s) from a given
URL/path (one HTML interface (not generated), data source
anywhere). JSon is generated from YAML data files prepared by user,
HTML pages are static and are not influenced by data i.e. HTML is not
re-generated.


Technology
----------
* HTML 5 web
* Python generator


Configuration
-------------
* Data are written in/converted from existing sources in YAML.
* NICE: web interface/desktop tool (console) for data management
  (add new training) ensures validity e.g. in Qt/Python.
* Simple validation tool that performs also YAML to JSon conversion.


Statistics
----------

* Pages:
 * All RUNning training units by time.
 * All RUNning training units by distance.
 * All (sports) training units by time/distance.
 * Statistics (might be on homepage)
   * Average time/distance/... for training units in every sport
   * Max time/distance/... for training units in every sport
   * Min time/distance/... for training units in every sport
   * All runs/rows/... by time/distance
